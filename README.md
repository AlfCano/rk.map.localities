# rk.map.localities
Connects RKWard to the high-resolution GADM database via the `geodata` package. While other plugins (like `rk.rnaturalearth`) focus on national and state-level maps, this plugin specializes in downloading **Admin Level 2 boundaries** (Municipalities, Counties, Districts) for detailed local analysis.
